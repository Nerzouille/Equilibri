## 9. Health Data Generator - Testing & Development

### Overview
To facilitate development and testing of the HealthMate application, we've created a realistic health data generator that produces believable user activity patterns over a 7-day period.

### Location
```
src/python/normal_history_generator.py
```

### ðŸš€ How to Use
```bash
# Run the generator
python src/python/normal_history_generator.py

# Output file
src/python/health_data.json
```

### What it Generates
The script creates **7 days** of realistic health data including:

| Metric | Description | Realistic Features |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sleep Hours** | 6.0-8.5h weekdays, 7.0-9.5h weekends | Weekend sleep-ins |
| **Daily Steps** | 6k-12k weekdays, 4k-8k weekends | Work vs. leisure patterns |
| **Hydration** | 1.0-2.5L | Correlates with activity level |
| **Heart Rate** | 55-80 bpm | Affected by sleep quality |
| **Screen Time** | 2.0-7.0h | Higher on weekends & low activity days |
| **Stress Level** | low/medium/high | Based on sleep, activity, day type |
| **Mood** | good/neutral/bad | Influenced by previous day & stress |

### Smart Correlations
The generator creates **realistic relationships** between metrics:

- **Poor sleep** â†’ Higher heart rate + more stress
- **Weekend patterns** â†’ More sleep, less steps, more screen time
- **High activity** â†’ Better hydration + lower stress
- **Mood continuity** â†’ Yesterday's mood influences today's
- **Cascading effects** â†’ One bad day can affect the next

### Sample Output
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "day_of_week": "Monday",
    "sleep_hours": 7.2,
    "steps": 8500,
    "hydration_liters": 1.8,
    "heart_rate_rest": 62,
    "screen_time_hours": 4.5,
    "stress_level": "medium",
    "mood": "good",
    "is_weekend": false
  }
]
```

### Why Use This?
- **Test AI algorithms** with realistic patterns
- **Demo the app** with believable user journeys
- **Validate health scoring** logic with correlated data
- **Debug edge cases** like stress spikes or mood dips
- **No privacy concerns** - completely synthetic data

### Customization
Easy to modify for different user profiles by adjusting the base ranges in `generate_realistic_day()` function.
