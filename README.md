### Core Components

#### 1. ML Health Scorer (`ml_health_scorer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main ML engine that predicts health scores from daily metrics
- **Models**: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (auto-selects best performer)
- **Features**: Sleep, steps, hydration, heart rate, stress, mood, screen time
- **Output**: Health score from 0-100

#### 2. Data Generator (`data_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Creates realistic synthetic health data for training and testing
- **Profiles**: Supports different user types (athlete, stressed, sedentary, etc.)
- **Realism**: Correlates metrics (poor sleep â†’ higher heart rate, weekend patterns)
- **Output**: JSON dataset with 7+ days of health data

### How the Data Generator Works

The data generator (`data_generator.py`) creates realistic synthetic health data by simulating different user profiles and their behavioral patterns:

#### User Profiles
- **Normal** (70%): Typical user with average habits
- **Athlete**: High activity, good sleep, low screen time
- **Stressed**: Poor sleep, high heart rate, irregular patterns
- **Sedentary**: Low steps, high screen time, poor hydration
- **Insomniac**: Very low sleep hours (3-5h), cascading effects
- **Overworker**: Long screen time, poor sleep, high stress
- **Healthy**: Optimal across all metrics
- **Unhealthy**: Poor habits across multiple areas

#### Realistic Correlations
The generator creates believable relationships between metrics:
- **Poor sleep** â†’ Higher heart rate + increased stress
- **Weekend patterns** â†’ More sleep, fewer steps, more screen time
- **High activity** â†’ Better hydration needs + lower stress
- **Stress cascade** â†’ Bad day affects next day's mood
- **Seasonal effects** â†’ Weather impacts activity and mood

#### Sample Generation Process
```python
# 1. Choose profile (70% normal, 30% extreme)
profile = generate_extreme_profile()

# 2. Generate base metrics based on profile
if profile == "athlete":
    sleep_hours = 7.5-9.5h
    steps = 15,000-25,000
    hydration = 3.0-5.0L
    
# 3. Apply correlations and adjustments
heart_rate = base_rate + sleep_penalty - fitness_factor
hydration *= activity_boost * weekend_factor

# 4. Add realistic noise and constraints
final_value = max(min_value, min(max_value, calculated_value))
```

#### Why This Approach Works
- **Diversity**: 8 different user profiles ensure model sees edge cases
- **Realism**: Correlations match real-world health patterns
- **Scalability**: Can generate thousands of days for robust training
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new profiles or adjust existing ones
- **Privacy**: No real user data needed for development

#### Example Generated Day
```json
{
  "profile": "stressed",
  "sleep_hours": 5.2,        // Poor sleep (stressed profile)
  "steps": 3400,             // Low activity (stress impact)
  "hydration_liters": 1.1,   // Forgot to drink water
  "heart_rate_rest": 82,     // Elevated (stress + poor sleep)
  "stress_level": "high",    // Direct from profile
  "mood": "bad",             // Influenced by previous day
  "screen_time_hours": 9.2,  // High (sedentary behavior)
  "is_weekend": false
}
```

#### 3. Model Training (`train_health_model.py`)
- **Purpose**: Trains ML models on generated data
- **Process**: Generates 2000+ days of synthetic data, trains multiple models
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and test set evaluation
- **Output**: Trained model saved as `health_model.pkl`

#### 4. Prediction Interface (`predict_health_score.py`)
- **Purpose**: Predicts health score for new user data
- **Input**: JSON file or hardcoded example data
- **Usage**: `python predict_health_score.py user_data.json`
- **Output**: Predicted health score
